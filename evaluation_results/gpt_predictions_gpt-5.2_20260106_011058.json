Conditional independences are used only to remove edges (or to orient colliders once edges exist). But here there are **no edges left**, and the premise even says every pair remains independent under every conditioning set listed.\n\nSo the resulting Markov equivalence class is simply: **no causal connections among A, B, C, D**.\n\n### Step 3: Test the hypothesis against what the discovered structure allows\n\nHypothesis: **\u201cC causes something else which causes A.\u201d**\n\nGiven the **closed system of 4 variables**, \u201csomething else\u201d would have to be **B or D** (since no other variable exists).\n\nSo the hypothesis would imply at least one of these directed chains:\n\n- \\(C \\to B \\to A\\), or\n- \\(C \\to D \\to A\\)\n\nEither chain contains a causal path from \\(C\\) to \\(A\\), which (under standard PC assumptions like Markov + faithfulness) would typically induce **dependence** between \\(C\\) and \\(A\\) (at least marginally or under some conditioning sets).  \n\nBut the premise states:\n\n- \\(A \\perp C\\) (marginally), and also\n- \\(A \\perp C \\mid B\\),\n- \\(A \\perp C \\mid D\\),\n- \\(A \\perp C \\mid B,D\\),\n\netc.\n\nThis is incompatible with there being a causal chain from \\(C\\) to \\(A\\) through \\(B\\) or \\(D\\) in a faithful model, and in PC terms it\u2019s incompatible with the learned empty skeleton (since a chain would require adjacencies).\n\nTherefore, the hypothesis is **not implied** by the premise (indeed, it is ruled out under the usual assumptions).\n\nTherefore: No",

Under the faithfulness logic that PC relies on, this means there is no causal connection/path that would make \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) influence \\(D\\). In particular, \\(A \\to D\\) or \\(B \\to D\\) would contradict the marginal independences.

We have:\n- \\(A \\perp B\\) (unconditional), so a valid separating set is \\(\\emptyset\\)\nThus \\(\\text{Sepset}(A,B)=\\emptyset\\), and in particular:\n- \\(C \\notin \\text{Sepset}(A,B)\\)\n\nTherefore PC orients:\n\\[\nB \\rightarrow C \\leftarrow A\n\\]\nSo **\\(C\\) is a collider** on the path \\(B - C - A\\).\n\n### Triple \\(C - A - D\\)\nThis is unshielded because \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) are not adjacent (we removed \\(C{-}D\\)).\n\nWe check whether \\(A\\) is in \\(\\text{Sepset}(C,D)\\).

However, the Premise states:\n\\[\nC \\perp D \\mid A\n\\]\nSo \\(A\\) **cannot** be a collider of \\(C\\) and \\(D\\).\n\nAlso, from the oriented collider earlier we already have \\(A \\rightarrow C\\), so \\(C \\rightarrow A\\) is incompatible with that forced orientation.\n\n### Can \\(X=B\\)?\nThat would require \\(D \\rightarrow B\\) and \\(C \\rightarrow B\\).

In particular:\n\n- \\(D\\) is adjacent to \\(A\\) but **not** to \\(C\\) (edge \\(C{-}D\\) was removed due to \\(C \\perp D \\mid A\\)).\n- \\(B\\) is adjacent to \\(C\\) but **not** to \\(A\\) (since \\(A \\perp B\\) marginally).\n\nThus, under the PC/faithfulness reading of the premise, it is impossible to have any \\(X\\) with \\(A \\to X \\leftarrow C\\), because there is no candidate \\(X\\) that can receive arrows from **both** \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) without requiring missing edges.\n\nSo the premise does **not** force (and in fact rules out, in the PC sense) the existence of a collider that is a common effect of \\(A\\) and \\(C\\).\n\nTherefore: No",

So we do **not** infer \\(B\\to A\\leftarrow E\\), etc.\n\nAlso, inside \\(\\{A,B,C,D\\}\\) the graph is fully connected, so there are **no unshielded triples** there, hence no collider orientations are forced.\n\n### 4) What causal conclusions are (not) implied?\n- Since \\(D-E\\) edge is removed in the skeleton, **\\(D\\) cannot be a *direct* cause of \\(E\\)** in any DAG consistent with the independences.
