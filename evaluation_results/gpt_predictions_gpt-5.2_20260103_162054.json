That is compatible with:\n- **Direct causation** \\(B \\to C\\) (direct cause), *and also*\n- **Indirect causation** \\(B \\to D \\to C\\) (not direct), *and also*\n- other structures that keep \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) dependent.\n\nIn fact, an explicit countermodel consistent with all given marginal relations and \\(A \\perp B\\) is:\n\n- \\(A \\to D \\leftarrow B\\) (collider at \\(D\\), so \\(A \\perp B\\))\n- \\(D \\to C\\)\n- \\(A \\to C\\)\n\nThen:\n- \\(A\\) correlates with \\(D\\) and with \\(C\\)\n- \\(B\\) correlates with \\(D\\) and with \\(C\\) (via \\(B \\to D \\to C\\))\n- \\(C\\) correlates with \\(D\\)\n- \\(A \\perp B\\)\n- and **\\(B\\) is an indirect cause of \\(C\\)** (no direct \\(B \\to C\\))\n\nBut there are also models consistent with the same marginal facts where \\(B \\to C\\) **is** direct.
